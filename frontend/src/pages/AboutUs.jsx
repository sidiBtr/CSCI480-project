         <p>The Millstream Wood Carvers owes its existence to the imagination of our founder, Thomas O. Miller.</p>
         <p>
         Tom was introduced to wood carving in 1983 through a course taught at Findlay High School. He was so moved by the experience
         that he decided to surround himself with fellow carvers who shared his interests. Through his tireless efforts, the organization was 
         inaugurated in August 1985 with 23 charter members. Monthly meetings were being held at various locations until Mr. Miller 
         donated his in-laws' estate to Millstream Wood Carvers in 1997, along with a generous contribution to a trust fund to meet
         future expenses.

          The 'Miller House' which served as a tavern during the time of Findlay's Gas Boom era, was in rather decrepit state, not very
          suitable for meetings. To satisfy the organization's needs, a two-car garage was erected on the property, half of which was dedicated
          to the storage of various equipment, while the other section was designed as a meeting place for the members. The growth of
          the organization soon exceeded the available space, and the entire building was converted to serve as a carving/meeting place with the 
          equipment being relocated to a donated shed.

          An expansion in 2014 increased the size of the clubhouse to nearly 1,400 square feet, and a further addition two years later
          added space for a power carving room and wood storage. The original house continued to deteriorate, and it was eventually
          razed in 2017.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is through the original generosity of Mr. Thomas O. Miller and the subsequent unselfish contributions of its members that 
          has allowed the Millstream Wood Carvers to continue to flourish in a spacious and comfortable environment,
          dedicated to sharing their enthusiasm for wood carving with anyone who is interested.
